## ⚠️ Minor Items Needed

### 🖼️ App Icons (Optional)
The app works without custom icons but looks better with them:

```bash
# Create /icons/ directory with:
- icon-192x192.png
- icon-512x512.png
- (other sizes optional)
```

### 🔒 HTTPS (For Full PWA)
For complete PWA testing, deploy to HTTPS:
- Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages
- Or use Chrome flags to bypass HTTPS requirement
